# Tableau-Executive-Overview-Sales-Profitability-Dashboard
This project started with a simple goal: visualize sales data overview across US. But it quickly turned into something much more valuable, a way to understand *where* the business is truly profitable, and *where* it's not.

Built using Tableau and the Sample Superstore dataset, this dashboard helps answer questions that go beyond KPIs:

- Are we really making money, or just making sales?
- Where are we giving away margins without realizing it?
- Are discounts creating growth or quietly killing profit?
- Which category or customers actually drive value?

## About the Dataset

The Sample Superstore dataset is a public retail dataset that mimics U.S. sales performance over 3 years. It includes:
- 9,900+ transactions  
- Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity  
- Region, State, City  
- Customer Segment & Product Category
It's simple but rich enough to uncover some powerful insights when looked at through the right lens.

## üîç Insights That Stood Out

- **High sales can still mean low returns**  
  - Illinois generated over `$119K` in sales‚Ä¶ but a **-15.7%** profit ratio

  - Cities like **Carrollton**, **Peoria**, and **Tigard** consistently returned **negative profits**  
  - These red flags were hidden in overall state performance

- **Discounts over 25% hurt more than they help**  
  - In several regions, average discounts of 30%+ directly aligned with **-20%+ profit ratios**

- **Segment performance isn‚Äôt just about volume**  
  - **Consumer** segment brought the most orders ‚Äî but **Corporate** delivered **higher profit per order**  
  - **Home Office** showed seasonal spikes, especially in Q4

- **Category performance isn‚Äôt all equal**  
  - **Technology** was the most profitable ‚Äî especially during year-end  
  - **Furniture** had consistent sales‚Ä¶ but the **lowest profit ratio**  
  - **Office Supplies** delivered stable, low-risk revenue
