# 📊 Executive Sales & Profitability Dashboard – Built in Tableau
| A data-driven executive overview to uncover where the business is truly profitable — and where it's silently losing money.

---

This project began with a simple goal: **visualize sales data across the U.S.**
But it quickly evolved into something far more valuable — a tool to uncover **where the business is truly profitable** and where it’s silently losing money.

Built using **Tableau** and the **Sample Superstore** dataset, this dashboard empowers users to answer questions that go well beyond top-line KPIs:

* Are we actually **making money**, or just **moving products**?
* Where are we unknowingly **sacrificing margins**?
* Are **discounts fueling growth**, or quietly eating into profits?
* Which **segments, categories, or customers** actually deliver sustainable value?

## 📦 About the Dataset

The **Sample Superstore** dataset mimics U.S. retail sales performance over three years. It's a popular, public dataset used for BI dashboards.

**It includes:**

* 9,900+ transactions
* Metrics: Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity
* Dimensions: Region, State, City, Segment, Category, Sub-Category

Simple in structure — yet rich enough to reveal **deep insights** when analyzed through the lens of **profitability**.
